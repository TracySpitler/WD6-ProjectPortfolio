** Essay **

35. Explain the differences between the Web Servers that are used in MEAN vs. LAMP. (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    MEAN uses MongoDB, which is a non-relational database, whereas LAMP uses MySQL, which is a relational database. The difference is in how data is stored. MongoDB (non-relational) data is represented in collections of JSON data. MySQL (relational) data is designated and saved in tables and rows.

36. What are two (2) main differences between Client vs. Server-side Programming? (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    Client-side programming applies languages such as JavaScript and CSS, which are responsible for what the user is seeing and interacting with (UI/UX). The server-side is the section that talks to the machine. Here you use languages such as PHP.

37. Compare & contrast at least two (2) key differences between Cookies & Sessions. (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    The main difference between cookies and sessions is that cookies are stored in the client's browser and sessions are stored server-side. Another key difference: cookies can only store one variable, whereas sessions can store multiple.

38. Describe NPM, the purpose of it, and explain its functionality. (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    NPM stands for Node package manager and is precisely that for JavaScript. Once NPM is installed, installing and requiring a project is a simple npm install command. The packages contain reusable code that helps ease the project's development.

39. What is an API and how do they work differently in Node.js vs PHP? (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    API stands for Application Programming Interface and is used to interact with a site and it's passed data. Node.js is asynchronous in nature, which means it won't get hung up on functions that haven't completed or didn't work. PHP switches language syntax quite often. 

40. Name AND describe EACH of the 5 states of the Agile Development Life Cycle. (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    The 5 stages of agile development are, in order, Envision, Speculate, Explore, Adapt, and Close. The Envision phase is where you create the scope of the project and plan out all the details. The Speculate phase is where the team identifies the features of the project. The Explore phase is where everyone can start to build out what they have thought up in the last two phases. The Adapt phase is where the team fixes what is not working and makes any last changes. The process is repeated until the project is finished. The Close phase is the last phase when all your work is done.

41. Explain CRUD and how it allow you to manipulate databases. (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. They are functions that allow users to interact and manipulate data within a database.

42. Why is it important for WDD students to learn to work within a team environment? Also, explain why it's important to have a resume & online portfolio before graduating? (—Explain in 2 sentences)

    The ability to work with and collaborate effectively with a team is imperative in the workplace, therefore making it essential for WDD students to learn as well. No great things are done alone. A resume and an online portfolio are necessary to get started finding a career. These tell possible future employers about you and what your skills are.
